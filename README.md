I am not maintaining this project anymore. However feel free to check ![josephlewis42's fork](https://github.com/josephlewis42/githubbeat).

## Why Githubbeat ?

Monitoring the activity of a project through externals services involved in the
lifetime of an opensource project can provide important insights about its
health and the activity of its community.

Githubbeat was built in order to monitor the activity of various github
repositories or even complete organizations through basic github stats like
open issues count or number of forks.

As a beat It ships everything directly to all supported outputs, depending of
your needs.
